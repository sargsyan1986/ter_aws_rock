Before you start creating, you'll need the following:

    1. an AWS account;
    2. identity and access management (IAM) credentials and programmatic access;
    3. AWS credentials that are set up locally with aws configure;
    4. a Virtual Private Cloud configured for EKS; and
    5. a code or text editor, like VS Code.
